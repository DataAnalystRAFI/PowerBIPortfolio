# PowerBI Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my PowerBI Portfolio! This repository showcases the results of my data visualization and analysis projects using Microsoft Power BI. Here, I present insights and findings from three distinct projects: Pizza Sales, HR Analytics - Employee Presence Insights, and Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Domain.

## Project 1: Pizza Sales

In the **Pizza Sales** project, I dive into sales data from a fictional pizza chain to uncover patterns and trends. Through interactive dashboards and visualizations, I explore factors that contribute to higher sales, peak sales periods, popular pizza choices, and more. This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw sales data into actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Project 2: HR Analytics - Employee Presence Insights

The **HR Analytics** project focuses on analyzing employee attendance and presence patterns within an organization. By visualizing attendance data and combining it with other relevant HR metrics, I provide insights into employee engagement, absenteeism trends, and their potential impact on productivity. This project showcases my skills in HR data analysis and visualization.

## Project 3: Revenue Insights - Hospitality Domain

In the **Revenue Insights** project, I tackle data from the hospitality domain to uncover revenue trends and opportunities. By creating intuitive visualizations, I help stakeholders understand booking patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and the effectiveness of promotions. This project illustrates my capability to handle domain-specific data and provide valuable insights to drive business strategies.
